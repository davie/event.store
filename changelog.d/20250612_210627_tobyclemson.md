### Changed

- `BrokerType` and `StorageType`, used when invoking `make_event_broker`, have
  been renamed to `EventBrokerType` and `EventBrokerStorageType` respectively.

### Added

- `SingletonEventBrokerTypeType`, `DistributedEventBrokerTypeType`,
  `InMemoryEventBrokerStorageTypeType` and `PostgresEventBrokerStorageTypeType` 
  have been exported from `logicblocks.event.processing` so that they can
  be used wherever types are needed for the `EventBrokerType.Singleton` and `EventBrokerType.Distributed` broker type specifiers.
